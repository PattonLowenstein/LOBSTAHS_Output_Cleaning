# LOBSTAHS_Output_Cleaning

# This program takes the "screened peak data" .csv file output by LOBSTAHS, 
# cleans it up, then outputs an excel workbook
#
# Primary functions are - remove features with RT < 5 min (300s)
#                       - separate oxidized and non-oxidized features into another sheet
#                       - separate odd numbered acyl chains
#                       - separate pigments
# Optional visualizations - MGDG, DGDG, SQDG, and PG individually
#                         - others to come
